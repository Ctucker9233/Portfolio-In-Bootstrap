I am recreating my basic portfolio page using bootstrap

Here is my home page.

Clicking on the contact link will take you to my contact page.

Clicking on the portfolio link will take you to my portfolio page.

Clicking on the about me link will return you to the home page.

Here is an example of the responsive nature of the pages. Try this out with any page by resizing the screen.
